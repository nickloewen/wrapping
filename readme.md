# Wrapping Paper Generator

A web page which generates random text based on simple text input (ie someoneâ€™s
name), intended to be printed and used as wrapping paper. Fills the page with
the text when it is printed from the browser.

## Potential Improvements ('To Do')

* handle long input better: insure that the input is returned in order at least once
* provide an option to highlight the first (or every) instance of the input
  which appears in the correct order
