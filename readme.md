# Wrapping Paper Generator

A web page which generates random text based on simple text input (ie someone’s
name), intended to be printed and used as wrapping paper. Fills the page with
the text when it is printed from the browser.

## Notes

* Browsers insist on adding margins in order to make the printed output fit the page.
  Firefox adds larger margins than Chrome.

## Recommended Symbols

Some fun unicode symbols to play with: ♡ ♥ ❆ ❅ ❄ ☃

## Potential Improvements ('To Do')

* handle long input better: insure that the input is returned in order at least once
* provide an option to highlight the first (or every) instance of the input
  which appears in the correct order

## Bugs (also 'To Do')

* none known!
