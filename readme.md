# Wrapping Paper Generator

A web page which generates random text based on simple text input (ie someoneâ€™s
name), intended to be printed and used as wrapping paper. Fills the page with
the text when it is printed from the browser.

## Notes

* Browsers insist on adding margins in order to make the printed output fit the page.
  Firefox adds larger margins than Chrome.

## Potential Improvements ('To Do')

* handle long input better: insure that the input is returned in order at least once
* provide an option to highlight the first (or every) instance of the input
  which appears in the correct order

## Bugs (also 'To Do')

* text generated without spaces doesn't print properly (presumably fixable
  with a word-break setting)
